If you don't include one or more of the following at least in your intial prompt, \
the AI will not know anything about your codebase:

| Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `folder(/)` | Include all files in the project folder |
| `folder(/my/folder/name/)` | Include all files in the folder |
| `file(/my/file/name.py)` | Include a specific file |
| `block(BlockName)` | Include a specific code block, identified by `{TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN}` and `{TAG_BLOCK_END}` comment lines in your code |

Once you've mentioned a file(), folder(), or block() in your current conversation thread, \
you don't need to mention it again because it will remain in the conversation context. Mentioning a file, folder, or \
block will insert the entire content of that code into the context for the LLM, so you can ask questions abou it. 

#### Example Prompts

```
In my HTML file in the project below, change the title "Hello World" to "Hello Universe".

folder(/)
```

```
What does this code do? And do you see any bugs in it?

```

```
Do you see any ways to optimized the following code?
