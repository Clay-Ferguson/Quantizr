    # Theoretically it should have been possible to let mongo run internally on 27017 (it's default) and then expose it
    # to the outside as 27016, but I never could get that to work, so I'm just setting it up to run at 27016 both
    # internaly and externally

    # NOTE: Minimal requirements for the mongod.conf is to have the port set as 27016, and the data db set
