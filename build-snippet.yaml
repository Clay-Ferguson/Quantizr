        # Tip: If you run 'docker-compose build' with this 'build' yaml property here, then as long as the
        # dockerfile and the springboot JAR are in the current folder it will succeed and update 
        # your docker images to contain the image: subnode/repo:quanta${QUANTA_VER}, rather than attempting to
        # download the image from the docker repository.
