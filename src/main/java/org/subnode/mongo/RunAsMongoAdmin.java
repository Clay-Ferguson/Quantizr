/**
 * Helper class to run some processing workload as the admin user. Simplifies by
 * encapsulating the session management at this abstracted layer. Run primarily
 * as a Java-8 Lambda, and working very similar to what is also known as an AOP
 * aspect, although not using an 'aspect' but mainly just a Lambda (i.e.
 * 'Functional Interface')
