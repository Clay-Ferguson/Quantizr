/**
 * This class was for proving how certain aspects of inheritance work in TypeScript
 * related to Fat Arrow functions, binding, and overriding base class functions. There are only
 * a handful of files with "Demo" in their filename, and those can be removed from this project and
 * the web app will still work fine of course.
 *
 * Important rules of thumb:
 *
 * For a normal class member (no arrow function) if you are ever using it in a way that's not an 'immediate call'
 * then you need to be sure it's either binded, or a fat arrow function.
