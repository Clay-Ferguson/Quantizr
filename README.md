# Quanta Web Platform

### Social Media and Content Mangement/Publishing

Welcome to the Fediverse!

A new kind of social media and content management platform. Connect to the Fediverse with unique and powerful features like wikis, blogging, document collaboration, conversation threads, encrypted secure messaging, video/audio recording & sharing, file sharing, a podcatcher, and much more.

Create hierarchically organized content that's always editable like a wiki and shared on the Fediverse and/or IPFS. Quanta is a new kind of platform with a new kind of architecture where you always have complete control of your own data.

Designed to allow a more fine-grained hierarchical approach to content management, collaborative documents, wikis, and micro-blogs, Quanta "quantizes" each piece of content as tree nodes. These nodes are the main elements of the app, similar to Facebook Posts or Twitter Tweets. Quanta has a unique and more powerful design, allowing content to be organized into larger structures of information, to create arbitrary data structures representing documents, wikis, web pages, blogs, etc.
