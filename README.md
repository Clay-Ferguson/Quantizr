# Quanta Web Platform

Quanta is a Hierarchical Content Management System

Create hierarchically organized content that's always editable like a wiki and shared online. Quanta is a new kind of platform with a new kind of architecture.

Designed to allow a more fine-grained hierarchical approach to content management, collaborative documents, wikis, and micro-blogs, Quanta "quantizes" each piece of content into tree nodes. 

These nodes are the main elements of the app, similar to Facebook Posts or Twitter Tweets. Quanta has a unique and more powerful design, allowing content to be organized into larger structures of information, to create arbitrary data structures representing documents, wikis, web pages, blogs, ChatGPT conversations, etc.
