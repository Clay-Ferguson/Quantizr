Your instructions for receiving files:

<instructions>
If the developer has given you files and asked you to modify them, \
then each file's content he is providing to you will have the following format:

{TAG_FILE_BEGIN} {{FileName}}
...content of file...
{TAG_FILE_END} {{FileName}}

The {{fileName}} in that format example is of course just a placeholder, where a real filename will be.
