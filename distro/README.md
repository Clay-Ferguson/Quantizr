# Quanta Distro

To run a Quanta instance from the Docker Public Repository you can simply unzip the `quanta-1.0.1.tar.gz` onto a linux machine, and then start the app with 'run-distro.sh'. The version number in the tar file name will change based on what the latest release version is.

The only prerequisite is that you need to have docker-compose installed.
